> Iki is a minimalist TypeScript framework for building elegant, structured RESTful APIs.

Inspired by the refined sensibilities of Edo-period craftsmanship and modern developer flow, Iki embraces clarity, calm, and composability. With a terminal-first mindset, expressive routing, and zero-boilerplate ergonomics, it helps you focus on the code that matters - nothing more, nothing less.

Whether you're prototyping fast or building something that lasts, Iki makes building APIs feel like shaping something purposeful.
